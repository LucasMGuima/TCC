abstract = {The explosive growth of the location-enabled devices coupled with the increasing use of Internet services has led to an increasing awareness of the importance and usage of geospatial information in many applications. The mobile navigation apps (often called "Maps"), use a variety of available data sources to calculate and predict the travel time for different modes. This paper evaluates the pedestrian mode of Maps apps in three major smartphone operating systems (Android, iOS and Windows Phone). We will demonstrate that the Maps apps on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in pedestrian mode, predict travel time without learning from the individual's movement profile. Then, we will exemplify that those apps suffer from a specific data quality issue (the absence of information about location and type of pedestrian crossings). Finally, we will illustrate learning from movement profile of individuals using predictive analytics models to improve the accuracy of travel time estimation for each user (personalization).},

abstract = {Indoor localization is essential for healthcare, security, augmented reality gaming, and many other location-based services. There is currently a wealth of relevant literature on indoor localization. This article focuses on recent advances in indoor localization methods that use spatial context to improve the location estimation. Spatial context in the form of maps and spatial models have been used to improve the localization by constraining location estimates in the navigable parts of indoor environments. Landmarks such as doors and corners, which are also one form of spatial context, have proved useful in assisting indoor localization by correcting the localization error. This survey gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art indoor localization methods and localization improvement methods using maps, spatial models, and landmarks.},
